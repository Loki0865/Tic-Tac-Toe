# Tic Tac Toe Game in C++

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game project! This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe using C++. It provides a command-line interface for two players to compete in this well-known game of strategy.

## Features

- **Two-player gameplay**: Play against a friend locally.
- **Simple Command-Line Interface**: Easy to use with a clear display of the game board.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures valid moves are made by players.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Basic understanding of C++ and command-line interfaces

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-cpp.git
   cd tic-tac-toe-cpp
   ```

2. **Compile the Code**:
   Use your preferred C++ compiler to compile the source files. For example:
   ```bash
   g++ -o tic_tac_toe main.cpp
   ```

3. **Run the Game**:
   Execute the compiled binary:
   ```bash
   ./tic_tac_toe
   ```

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Launch the executable.
2. **Make Your Move**: Players take turns to enter their move. The board is numbered 1 to 9.
3. **Winning the Game**: The first player to align three of their symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
4. **Game Over**: The game ends when there's a winner or all spaces are filled.

## Code Structure

- `main.cpp`: Contains the main logic for the game including the game loop, board display, and move validation.
- `game.cpp`: Defines the game logic functions (e.g., checking for a winner).
- `game.h`: Contains the declarations for game functions and data structures.
